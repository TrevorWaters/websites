# My web projects

## Highlights:

- ### Blazor/kristinsite/ ### 
a project I started working on for my girlfriend. The incomplete result consists of mostly a working Product page, however it was a cool milestone for me as I learned about Blazor.  
  
- ### /Blazor/TaxCertPortal/ ### 
I introduced myself to gRPC and got it working in a v1 app that I am using to track my County Tax Certificate purchases. Working on a v2 using Clean Architecture
  
- ### /Blazor/UserPortal/ ###
This is a small demo application I created to show my project manager the power of Blazor; we are now using Blazor on our newest applications! 
   
- ### /Blazor/Components/ ###
These are mostly components I am currently working/have recently worked on for my job.  
  
- ### /Work/Exercise 1/ ###
This is an exercise I created entirely on my own (except for the MockUps, which I adapted from someone else), after being asked by my project manager to create an exercise for potential candidates for hire. I then participated in the reviewing of approximately 7 submissions from October 2021 - December 2021.  


Thank you!
